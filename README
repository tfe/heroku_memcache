[`heroku_memcache`](http://github.com/tfe/heroku_memcache/)
========

Sets a global variable `$heroku_memcache` which you can then use anywhere in your app to access the Heroku-managed memcache cluster. If the app is not running on Heroku, this variable won't be defined and you should make other arrangements (see "Usage" below).

Note that if you are only going to use memcache through the `Rails.cache` methods (using `config.cache_store = :mem_cache_store`), you should just follow the [Heroku documentation](http://docs.heroku.com/memcache) and *not install this plugin*. Only install this if you need direct access to memcache for something specific (e.g. [`cache_money`](http://github.com/nkallen/cache-money)). Also take care not to cause cache key collisions if you have multiple things/plugins accessing your app's namespace on the Heroku memcache cluster.

Installation
------------

	script/plugin install git://github.com/tfe/heroku_memcache.git

----

Usage
-----

I have something like the following in `initializers/memcache_config.rb`:

	MEMCACHE = if $heroku_memcache
	  $heroku_memcache
	else
	  require 'memcache'
	  MemCache.new('localhost')
	end

If you don't want to run memcache on your development machine, you can probably get away with using an in-memory hash. Just replace `MemCache.new('localhost')` in the above with `{}`. It will behave the same for basic usage.

Credit
------

This is pretty much straight out of the Heroku memcache private beta docs.
